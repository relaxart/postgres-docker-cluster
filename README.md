# Streaming replication cluster for pgsql + pgpool2

## Info

### Publications
* [Article on Medium.com](https://medium.com/@dpaunin/postgresql-cluster-into-kubernetes-cluster-f353cde212de)
* [Статья на habr-e](https://habrahabr.ru/post/301370/)

### What's in the box
[This project](https://github.com/paunin/postgres-docker-cluster) includes:
* dockerfiles for `postgresql` cluster
    * [postgresql](./Pgsql.Dockerfile)
    * [pgpool](./Pgpool.Dockerfile)
* Examples of usage(suitable for production environment as architecture has fault protection with auto failover)
    * example of [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file to start this cluster.
    * directory [k8s](./k8s) contains information for building this cluster in kubernetes

### Artifacts

Two docker images were produced:
* Postgresql server image which can start in master or slave mode: https://hub.docker.com/r/paunin/postgresql-cluster-pgsql/
* Pgpool service with  flexible configurations: https://hub.docker.com/r/paunin/postgresql-cluster-pgpool/

## Schema of the example cluster

```
pgmaster (primary node1)  --|
|- pgslave1 (node2)       --|
|  |- pgslave2 (node3)    --|----pgpool (master_slave_mode stream)
|- pgslave3 (node4)       --|
   |- pgslave4 (node5)    --|
```

Each `postgres` node (`pgmaster`, `pgslaveX`) is managed by `repmgr/repmgrd`. It allows to use automatic `failover` and check cluster status.


## Start cluster with docker-compose

To start cluster run it as normal `docker-compose` application `docker-compose up -d`

Please check comments for each `ENV` variable in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file to understand parameter for cluster's node

## Start cluster in Kubernetes

To make it easier repository contains services' objects under `k8s` dir

* Requires software: `minikube` (for local tests) and `kubectl`
* Using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) you can start local Kubernetes cluster: `minikube start`, `minikube env`
* Setup `PostgreSQL` cluster: `kubectl create -f ./k8s/database-service/`
* Check everything works as expected
    * Proper DB operating:
      * Connect to any `postgres` node to be able to access DB (e.g. `docker-compose exec pgpool bash -c 'PGPASSWORD=$CHECK_PASSWORD psql -U $CHECK_USER -h localhost template1 -c "show pool_nodes"'`)
      * Do some read and write queries after connecting be command `PGPASSWORD=monkey_pass psql -U monkey_user -h database-pgpool-service -p 5432 monkey_db`
    * Check status/topology of the cluster (e.g. from master node) `gosu postgres repmgr cluster show`

Initial topology:
* Repmgr:
```
gosu postgres repmgr cluster show
[2016-12-28 06:46:13] [INFO] connecting to database
Role      | Name  | Upstream | Connection String
----------+-------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* master  | node1 |          | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgmaster dbname=replication_db port=5432 connect_timeout=2
  standby | node4 | node1    | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave3 dbname=replication_db port=5432 connect_timeout=2
  standby | node2 | node1    | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave1 dbname=replication_db port=5432 connect_timeout=2
  standby | node3 | node2    | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave2 dbname=replication_db port=5432 connect_timeout=2
  standby | node5 | node4    | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave4 dbname=replication_db port=5432 connect_timeout=2
```

* Pgpool:
```
PGPASSWORD=$CHECK_PASSWORD psql -U $CHECK_USER -h localhost template1 -c "show pool_nodes"
 node_id | hostname | port | status | lb_weight |  role   
---------+----------+------+--------+-----------+---------
 0       | pgmaster | 5432 | 2      | 0.250000  | primary
 1       | pgslave1 | 5432 | 2      | 0.250000  | standby
 2       | pgslave2 | 5432 | 2      | 0.250000  | standby
 3       | pgslave3 | 5432 | 2      | 0.250000  | standby
```

## Adaptive mode

'Adaptive mode' means that node will be able to decide if instead of acting as a master on it's start or switch to standby role.
That possible if you pass `PARTNER_NODES` (comma separated list of nodes in the cluster on the same level).
So every time container starts it will check if it was master before and if there is no new master around (from the list `PARTNER_NODES`),
otherwise it will start as a new standby node with `upstream = new master` in the cluster.

Keep in mind: this feature does not work for cascade replication and you should not pass `PARTNER_NODES` to nodes on second level of the cluster.
Instead of it just make sure that all nodes on the first level are running, so after restart any node from second level will be able to follow initial upstream from the first level.
That also can mean - replication from second level potentially can connect to root master... Well not a big deal if you've decided to go with adaptive mode.
But nevertheless you are able to play with `NODE_PRIORITY` environment variable and make sure entry point for second level of replication will never be elected as a new root master 

## Health-checks

To make sure you cluster works as expected without 'split-brain' or other issues, you have to setup health-checks and stop container if any health-check returns non-zero result.

* Postgres containers:
    * `/usr/local/bin/cluster/healthcheck/is_major_master.sh` - detect if node acts as a 'false'-master and there is another master - with more standbys
* Pgpool
    * `/usr/local/bin/pgpool/has_enough_backends.sh [REQUIRED_NUM_OF_BACKENDS, default=$REQUIRE_MIN_BACKENDS]` - check if there are enough backend behind `pgpool`
    * `/usr/local/bin/pgpool/has_write_node.sh` - check if one of the backend can be used as a master with write access

Abnormal but possible situation in cluster:
```
gosu postgres repmgr cluster show
Role      | Name  | Upstream | Connection String
----------+-------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  standby | node3 | node2    | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave2 dbname=replication_db port=5432
  standby | node5 | node4    | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave4 dbname=replication_db port=5432
* master  | node1 |          | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgmaster dbname=replication_db port=5432
* master  | node2 |          | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave1 dbname=replication_db port=5432
  standby | node4 | node2    | user=replication_user password=replication_pass host=pgslave3 dbname=replication_db port=5432
```

## Useful commands

* Get map of current cluster(on any `postgres` node): 
    * `gosu postgres repmgr cluster show` - tries to connect to all nodes on request ignore status of node in `repmgr_$CLUSTER_NAME.repl_nodes`
    * `gosu postgres psql $REPLICATION_DB -c "SELECT * FROM repmgr_$CLUSTER_NAME.repl_nodes"` - just select data from tables
* Get `pgpool` status (on any `pgpool` node): `PGPASSWORD=$CHECK_PASSWORD psql -U $CHECK_USER -h localhost template1 -c "show pool_nodes"`
* In `pgpool` container check if primary node exists: `/usr/local/bin/pgpool/has_write_node.sh` 

Any command might be wrapped with `docker-compose` or `kubectl` - `docker-compose exec {NODE} bash -c '{COMMAND}'` or `kubectl exec {POD_NAME} -- bash -c '{COMMAND}'`

* [How to promote master, after failover on postgresql with docker](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37710868/how-to-promote-master-after-failover-on-postgresql-with-docker)
* Killing of node in the middle (e.g. `pgslave1`) will cause dieing of whole branch (https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fil#!topic/repmgr/lPAYlawhL0o)
   * That make seance as second or deeper level of replication should not be able to connect to root master (it makes extra load on server) or change upstream at all
